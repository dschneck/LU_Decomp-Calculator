# Description

(2pts)  Write a program to do the same job as (or better) the website  does: https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/lu-decomposition-calculator/ (Links to an external site.)

Input: a square matrix 

Output: if exist LU factorization (better with steps) print the L and U matrices, if not, return that the matrix doesn't have LU factorization

Extra bouns: (1pts) input a general matrix, say m by n matrix, find if it has LU factorization, if yes, print the L and U matrix

(2pts) Input a general matrix,  search the concept about LPU decomposition, study the algorithm and realize it with any language.

Team: at most 4 members

Need presentation: Yes, and time is limited to 8 mins.

Due: Oct 25

## TODO ##
- [] algorithm for finding determinant of n x n matrix
- [] Check determinant of principal leading submatrices
- [x] algorithm for matrix multiplication
- [x] generate n x n identity matrix
- [] represent elementary row operations with matrices
- [] algorithm to invert elementary row operations
- [] validate by multplying L and U, the answer should be A
